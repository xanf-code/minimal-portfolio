            To make a long and boring story shorter: Now I work on backend
            software development and my work output is finally catching up to my
            moral principles and aesthetic ideals. Oh, and on the flip side, I
            grapple with jujitsu on the side!. I enjoy expressing myself through
            designs and code that's why I created .
